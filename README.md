# BCG vaccination induced DNA methylation changes and the role in cytokine responses

## Description
The analysese were performed within 300BCG cohort. <br>
The aim of this study is to understand the DNA methylatioin dynamic changes after BCG vaccination, <br>
as well as the role of DNA methylation in immune responses. <br>
